# Warcry Statshammer

A tool for calculating and comparing damage outputs for **Warhammer Warcry** fighters.
If you are interested in Age of Sigmar calculations, see the sister-project [AoS-Statshammer](https://aos-statshammer.herokuapp.com)

## Average Damage Stats

Gather the average damage that each unit is expected to do against various toughness values. This average is a calculated value (not simulated)

## Probabilities

Generates **Discrete** and **Cumulative** Probabilities which are calculated (not simulated). This is done by gathering every permutation of the dice roll(s) and uses that to get a population probability graph

## And More

Keep an eye on the [Github Releases](https://www.github.com/damonhook/warcry-statshammer), or the [Reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarcryStatshammer) to get notified of new additions

## Notes

This is a free community tool built by Damon Hook (`NoMaDhOoK`)

**Remember:** There is more to a fighter than just its damage output. This is a tool, not a definitive answer of which unit is better
